        "question": "Passage: Carbon\u2013hydrogen bond -- The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.\nQuestion: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen\nAnswer:",

A horseshoe-shaped par 5 hole once enabled a condor hole in one to be achieved with a 3-iron club. The longest recorded straight drive hole-in-one is believed to be 517 yards or 473 metres, on the par 5 No. 9 hole at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver in 2002, aided by the thin air due to the high altitude. None of these four par 5 holes-in-one were achieved during a professional tournament.

        "question": "Passage: Fox hunting -- Fox hunting with hounds, as a formalised activity, originated in England in the sixteenth century, in a form very similar to that practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force. A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and the United States. In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms, similar to deer hunting. In much of the world, hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g., deer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, ``hunting'' without qualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds--beagling, drag hunting, hunting the clean boot, mink hunting, or stag hunting), as described here.\nQuestion: do they still have fox hunts in england\nAnswer:",

The ASU coat has a tailored, athletic cut to improve uniform fit and appearance. The ASU includes an improved heavier and wrinkle resistant short and long-sleeved white shirt with permanent military creases and shoulder loops. The JROTC version replaces the white shirt with the prototype grey shirt and gold braid is not worn on the blue trousers or on the sleeves of the class A coat.

This training level includes more invasive procedures than are covered at the EMT-Basic level, including IV therapy, the use of advanced airway devices, and provides for advanced assessment skills. The EMT-I/85 typically administered the same medications as an EMT-B (oxygen, oral glucose, activated charcoal, epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPens), nitroglycerin, and metered-dose inhalers such as albuterol).

Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, 68 to 66 million years ago.
