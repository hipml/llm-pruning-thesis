        "question": "Passage: Break-in (mechanical run-in) -- A new engine is broken in by following specific driving guidelines during the first few hours of its use. The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the piston rings of the engine and the cylinder wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use. For example, the manual will specify that the car be driven normally, but not in excess of the highway speed limit.\nQuestion: do you need to break in a car\nAnswer:",

        "question": "Passage: Carbon\u2013hydrogen bond -- The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.\nQuestion: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen\nAnswer:",

        "question": "Passage: Fox hunting -- Fox hunting with hounds, as a formalised activity, originated in England in the sixteenth century, in a form very similar to that practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force. A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and the United States. In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms, similar to deer hunting. In much of the world, hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g., deer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, ``hunting'' without qualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds--beagling, drag hunting, hunting the clean boot, mink hunting, or stag hunting), as described here.\nQuestion: do they still have fox hunts in england\nAnswer:",
