        "question": "Passage: .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire -- The .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire, also called .22 WMR, .22 Magnum, .22 MRF, or .22 Mag, is a rimfire cartridge. Originally loaded with a bullet weight of 40 grains (2.6 g) delivering velocities in the 2,000 feet per second (610 m/s) range from a rifle barrel, .22 WMR is now loaded with bullet weights ranging from 50 grains (3.2 g) at 1,530 feet per second (470 m/s) to 30 grains (1.9 g) at 2,200 feet per second (670 m/s). Accuracy around 1 MOA is achievable. Compared to the faster but lighter .17 HMR, the .22 WMR impacts targets with higher kinetic energy within its effective range, important for clean kills on larger small game such as coyote, albeit with a less flat-shooting bullet arc.\nQuestion: is 22 magnum and 22 wmr the same\nAnswer:",

HeLa cells are rapidly dividing cancer cells, and the number of chromosomes varied during cancer formation and cell culture. The current estimate (excluding very tiny fragments) is a ``hypertriploid chromosome number (3n+)'' which means 76 to 80 total chromosomes (rather than the normal diploid number of 46) with 22--25 clonally abnormal chromosomes, known as HeLa signature chromosomes.'' The signature chromosomes can be derived from multiple original chromosomes, making challenging summary counts based on original numbering. Researchers have also noted how stable these aberrant karyotypes can be:\nQuestion: do hela cells have a normal number of chromosomes\nAnswer:",
