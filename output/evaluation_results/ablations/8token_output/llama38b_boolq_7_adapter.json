Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators.

Proposed following the often bitter 1787--88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

        "question": "Passage: Fifty Shades of Grey -- Princeton professor April Alliston wrote, ``Though no literary masterpiece, Fifty Shades is more than parasitic fan fiction based on the recent Twilight vampire series.'' Entertainment Weekly writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a ``B+'' rating and praised it for being ``in a class by itself.'' British author Jenny Colgan in The Guardian wrote ``It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act'' and also praised the book for being ``more enjoyable'' than other ``literary erotic books''. The Daily Telegraph noted that the book was ``the definition of a page-turner'', noting that the book was both ``troubling and intriguing''. A reviewer for the Ledger-Enquirer described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it ``also touches on one aspect of female existence (female submission). And acknowledging that fact -- maybe even appreciating it -- shouldn't be a cause for guilt.'' The New Zealand Herald stated that the book ``will win no prizes for its prose'' and that ``there are some exceedingly awful descriptions,'' although it was also an easy read; ``(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and your desire to -- if you'll pardon the expression -- slap the heroine for having so little self respect, you might enjoy it.'' The Columbus Dispatch stated that, ``Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page.'' Metro News Canada wrote that ``suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way''. Jessica Reaves, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that the ``book's source material isn't great literature'', noting that the novel is ``sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases'', and described it as ``depressing''.\nQuestion: is 50 shades of grey based off of twilight\nAnswer:",

As it turned out Emma made an appearance as the Dark One, with her new attire. Henry asks what happened to her, and she told them that they all went to Camelot to remove the darkness from her and they all failed (except Henry). Emma with her powers turned Sneezy into stone, proclaiming that there's no savior in the town. Emma surprisingly gave the Dark One dagger to Regina with the intention that if she goes too dark Regina would be the only one that would willingly ``put her down.'' Shortly after this, Hook attempts true love's kiss with Emma in the hopes that the Dark One's curse would break, but ultimately failed, as Emma has fully embraced the darkness. Unbeknownst to the others, Emma currently has possession of the Excalibur in a locked room inside of her new house. She intends to make Excalibur and the Dark One's dagger whole again, as with it she will be able to snuff out the light forever and become invulnerable. However, she must recruit a hero to do so, as she cannot remove the sword; the hero she chooses is her predecessor Rumplestiltskin, who she tells finally has a chance to become a hero. She planned to siphon the darkness out of both of them and put it Zelena, who she forced into an accelerated labor to avoid killing Robin's child, and slay her. She regains her memories of what Hook plans, by resurrecting all the Dark Ones as part of his revenge. At first, Emma plans to absorb all the darkness inside her and kill herself. Things do not go according to plan when Hook steals it from her. Killian orders her to kill him, taking in all the darkness and Emma slays him with Excalibur while the darkness is removed from her, reverting to her old self. After blackmailing Mr. Gold for tricking her and Hook into making him the Dark One again, she and her friends and family descend into the Underworld to find Hook and plans to split her heart in half and share it with him like her parents.\nQuestion: does emma swan stop being the dark one\nAnswer:",
