In New Jersey and Rhode Island, incest between consenting adults (16 or over for Rhode Island, 18 or over for New Jersey) is not a criminal offense, though marriage is not allowed in either state. New Jersey also increases the severity of underage sex offenses by a degree if they're also incestuous, and criminalizes incest with 16-17 year olds (the normal age of consent in New Jersey is 16).\nQuestion: are there any states where you can marry your sibling\nAnswer:",

Additionally, US federal law prohibits possession of firearms by those who have been dishonorably discharged per the Gun Control Act of 1968, and being dishonorably discharged is as well a disqualifying question on the Form 4473, which must be completed and signed to purchase a firearm from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) and will result in a denial by the Brady background check that must be performed and passed to allow a sale.\nQuestion: can you buy a gun if you are dishonorably discharged\nAnswer:",
