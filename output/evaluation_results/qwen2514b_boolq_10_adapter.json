        "question": "Passage: Dynamite -- In actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and Dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation castable explosive adopted by the military a full sixty years after Dynamite, which is a 1st generation phlegmatized explosive primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than Dynamite, as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, Dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: a full generation better than Dynamite, it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a blasting cap (or a sympathetic detonation); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at 178 \u00b0F, poured into high explosive shells and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics. As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, hand grenades and aerial bombs and the remainder being packaged in brown ``bricks'' (not red cylinders) for use as demolition charges by combat engineers.\nQuestion: is there a difference between dynamite and tnt\nAnswer:",
