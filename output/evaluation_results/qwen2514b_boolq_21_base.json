An integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include \u22124, 0, 82 and 178. In particular, zero is an even number.

Writer-director Bertino was inspired by real-life events: the Manson family Tate murders, a multiple homicide; the Keddie Cabin Murders, that occurred in California in 1981; and a series of break-ins that occurred in his own neighborhood as a child. Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006.\nQuestion: was the movie strangers based on a true story\nAnswer:",

Box 9975 (fictitious), the Street Addressing would be: 1598 Main Street Unit 9975, El Centro, CA. Nationally, the first five digits of the zip code may or may not be the same as the P.O.

In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called pterylae; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called apterylae (or apteria). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae.

        "question": "Passage: Carbon\u2013hydrogen bond -- The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons.\nQuestion: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen\nAnswer:",
