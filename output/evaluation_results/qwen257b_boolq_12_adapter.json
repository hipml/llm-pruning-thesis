In digital media, this ``blue pencil instruction text'' was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or ``instruction text encapsulated by tags.'' However the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or beginning of a next para...etc.).
